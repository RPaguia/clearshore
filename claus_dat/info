The CLAUS (Cloud over Auckland, Australia and US Shores) Dataset is a collection of satellite imagery constructed to support the development project. 
The EO Browser application of the Sentinel Hub provided an easy and collection access to these images, that allows for visualising the data from numerous satellites 
and data collections instantly.

The dataset contains high-resolution images of the four regions of interest (RoI): Hauraki Gulf (HG) and Mount John (MJ) within New Zealand, Lake Tahoe (TA) in US, 
and Lake Tuggeranong (TU) in Australia. These are grouped based on the sensor used (l8-9_l1 for Landsat 8-9, s2a_msil1c for Sentinel-2 Level 1), 
and the period of acquisition which ranges from Jan 1, 2022 until Jun 30, 2023 (H1 or H2 for every year).

A file naming connvention was implemented making the filenames more informative, i.e., 

CLS_MJ_2500X1254px_16m_S2A_MSIL1C_20220814_100CC

CLS          - to denote the clearshore project
MJ           - the RoI
2500X1254px  - the image size
16m          - the projected resolution (extracted from the EO Browser platform)
S2A_MSIL1C   - the sensor that acquired the image
20220814     - the date of the acquisition following the YYYYMMDD format.
100CC        - the estimated cloud cover percentage calculated as an average of all the cloud cover percentage (as provided by the EO Browser platform) for the day.
